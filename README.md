# Assignment-4

question 1 and 2 were working fine with no errors shown to me.Question 3 had problems where the circle would not be drawn in the specific way as asked.The circles would overlap 
and i was not able to figure out how to do them.My recursion is very weak at the moment and i need more practice to go with it.
Question 4 is something i couldnt solve logically and i was also out of time it couldnt be done or finished.
